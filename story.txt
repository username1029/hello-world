Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
Hmmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air
